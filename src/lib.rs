//! A lock that allows for an unlimited number of concurrent readers, which are never blocked.
//! Only one writer can access the resource at a time.
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use rculock::{RcuLock, RcuGuard};
//!
//! // Create a new RcuLock protecting a piece of data, in this case a number (u32).
//! let data: RcuLock<u32> = RcuLock::new(5);
//! assert_eq!(5, *data.read());
//! {
//!     // The data is cloned and handed to the writer
//!     let mut guard: RcuGuard<u32> = data.write();
//!     // RcuGuard implements `Deref` and `DerefMut` for easy access to the data.
//!     *guard = 4;
//!     // The writer has changed its copy of the data, but the changes
//!     // have not yet made it back to the master `RcuLock`.
//!     assert_eq!(5, *data.read());
//! }
//! // After the write guard is dropped, the state of the resource
//! // as the writer sees it is atomically stored back into the master RcuLock.
//! assert_eq!(4, *data.read());
